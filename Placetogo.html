    <p>Quy Nhon has a couple of attractions worth seeing and one of them is the Binh Dinh Museum. The right gallery is devoted to the struggles of the local Communist Party during the Vietnam War. The centre gallery features items from the French Colonial period and the left gallery showcases Cham sculptures.

The Thap Doi Cham Towers is another Quy Nhon attraction. It is unique because of the number of towers as well as its location. Most Cham towers are in odd-numbered groups and usually found on the hilltops, while this one consists of only two towers and is located in town. Anyone would be impressed with the relief on the sculptures, since they are still in good shape after all these years.

Long Khanh, which is Quy Nhon's main pagoda, is also worth the trip. Built in the 18th century, this attraction is notable because of its 17-metre high Buddha.

Other remarkable attractions are the picturesque Queen's Beach and the Quy Hoa Leper Colony. The former was named after the wife of Vietnam's last emperor and the latter consists of a hospital surrounded by gardens and homes of former patients.
